# Transfer Of Properties and Assets using Blockchain

With the increased population, the number of land registries has increases significantly and with such increase in the requirement, it becomes more and more difficult to keep a track of the old documentation and other than that also increases the workload over the offices for newer and newer registrations. In the past few years lot of flaws have been brought out with existing system making it more important to develop a new system based over blockchain technology. The reason for blockchain technology is because of its qualities such as immutability which makes it highly suitable for a rigid system which should have a very low change rate.
We as a team planned to make the project highly flexible for changes from our side, with each and every ground level understanding we executed something which could solve that problem. While using remix IDE to code smart contracts over Ethereum which are used for the property registry system. Hence the application is such that is been made over the past few months while understanding ground level problems. As a result, it is system devised to solve problems like fake registries, delayed heredity transfer and illegal occupation over land. System if implemented in real time would solve problems and can increase the productivity as well as the development of the nation seen as a whole picture

Implementation Detail:

=>The smart contract is deployed and can transact the entities present

=>It creates a hash function over successful transaction and entities can be checked Over debug function in the remix IDE.


Following are the implementation pictures of front end and Smart Contract
